            <h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
            <p>A wide range of volunteers with a variety of skills are required to make an event like Manchester Curious a success.</p>
            <p>We are currently looking for team members to join the committee to help drive the festival forward and assist with delivering the 2017 festival.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in becoming involved in Manchester Curious 2017 please <a href="mailto:info@manchestercurious.com">get in touch</a>.  All are welcome.</p>
            <h2>Building and Tour Hosts</h2>
            <p>Over 90% of the tickets were booked for the inaugural 2015 festival and we are looking to build on this success in 2017.</p>
            <p>We are on the lookout for spaces and tours for our 2017 programme, these include:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Interesting and innovative buildings</li>
               <li>Hidden spaces not usually open to the public</li>
               <li>New developments or sites that can be toured</li>
               <li>Walking tour guides</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We would love to hear from you if you have a building or tour that you think would be suitable for Manchester Curious, <a href="mailto:info@manchestercurious.com">info@manchestercurious.com</a>.</p>
            <p>Any suggestions of buildings or tours that you would like to see on the programme are also welcome.</p>
