        <p>Drawing inspiration from London Open House and Heritage Open Days, Manchester Curious is an independently run, not-for-profit event. The aim of Manchester Curious is to open the doors of some of Manchesterâ€™s finest buildings and hidden spaces to discover the secrets and innovations behind them, and also to give the opportunity to uncover the history, developments and context of Manchester through the ages with guided walking tours.</p>
        <p>Manchester Curious was successfully launched in 2015 with a party, attended by around 250 people, at the Old Granada Studios. The festival itself had 25 spaces, 34 tours and over 90% of tickets sold within two weeks of release. The festival received local and national media coverage, as well as 5,000 unique website visits and 300+ people who signed up to our mailing list.</p>
        <p>The 2017 festival will run from Thursday 4 May to Sunday 7th May and will again feature a series of guided tours and walks. These are designed to appeal to a wider audience, with the idea of making the concept of architecture accessible to all. We are currently working on the line up for 2017 but please see our <a href="programme2015.pdf">2015 programme</a> for an idea of what is to come.
